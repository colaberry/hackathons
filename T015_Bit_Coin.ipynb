    "# Bitcoin Price Analysis \n",
    "                \n",
    "## What is Bitcoin?\n",
    "- Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator.\n",
    "- Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.\n",
    "-  Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "   Harish Kashyap has shared a very extensive dataset historic price of bitcoins data originally provided by Bitcoin(BTC).The data was collected every other day since 2010 and daily since around 2018 over the span of 8 years.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The dataset consists of :\n",
    "- Date : Date of observation\n",
    "- btc_market_price : Average USD market price across major bitcoin exchanges.\n",
    "- btc_total_bitcoins : The total number of bitcoins that have already been mined.\n",
    "- btc_market_cap : The total USD value of bitcoin supply in circulation.\n",
    "- btc_trade_volume : The total USD value of trading volume on major bitcoin exchanges.\n",
    "- btc_blocks_size : The total size of all block headers and transactions.\n",
    "- btc_avg_block_size : The average block size in MB.\n",
    "- btc_n_orphaned_blocks : The total number of blocks mined but ultimately not attached to the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "- btc_n_transactions_per_block : The average number of transactions per block.\n",
    "- btc_median_confirmation_time : The median time for a transaction to be accepted into a mined block.\n",
    "- btc_hash_rate : The estimated number of tera hashes per second the Bitcoin network is performing.\n",
    "- btc_difficulty : A relative measure of how difficult it is to find a new block.\n",
    "- btc_miners_revenue : Total value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.\n",
    "- btc_transaction_fees : The total value of all transaction fees paid to miners.\n",
    "- btc_cost_per_transaction_percent : miners revenue as percentage of the transaction volume.\n",
    "- btc_cost_per_transaction : miners revenue divided by the number of transactions.\n",
    "- btc_n_unique_addresses : The total number of unique addresses used on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "- btc_n_transactions : The number of daily confirmed Bitcoin transactions.\n",
    "- btc_n_transactions_total : Total number of transactions.\n",
    "- btc_n_transactions_excluding_popular : The total number of Bitcoin transactions, excluding the 100 most popular addresses.\n",
    "- btc_n_transactions_excluding_chains_longer_than_100 : The total number of Bitcoin transactions per day excluding long -transaction chains.\n",
    "- btc_output_volume : The total value of all transaction outputs per day.\n",
    "- btc_estimated_transaction_volume : The total estimated value of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to visualize the dataset based on the time period to analyze its price over time .Plotting the patterns of different variables helps us understand to predict he future price of bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "    - Ingest the dataset into a format that is easy for analysis\n",
    "    - Explanatory data analysis and visualization of data\n",
    "    - Predicting the future price \n",
    "    \n",
    "###  Steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a dataframe and load the data into the dataframe. This step has been performed for you. A dataframe called          'bit_df' has been created and the dataset available at a remote server location is loaded into the dataframe.\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. One objective of the analysis is to compare the exchange rate to date.In order to calculate the exchange rate use the formula \n",
    "    Exchange rate=Value in USD/Number of bitcoins\n",
